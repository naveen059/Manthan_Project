## IDENTIFICATION OF ONLINE FAKE CONTENT

The primary objective of this problem statement is to identify fake & misleading content published on social media platforms, blogs, forums, news websites etc.

### Approach:
Fake content detection is the process of analyzing and classifying content as either real or fake. There are several techniques for identifying fake content and in recent years, the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches has become more common. These statistical detection techniques offer both better autonomy as well as higher detection rates. We model the different techniques that are used for different types of content that are observed on social media which include text, and image. These are not meant to be exhaustive but representative of the current trends in this research domain
We will device Supervised Machine learning techniques to deal with the problem
Machine learning utilizes data analysis by “learning” from a set (or sets) of data provided, and then makes a decision through the identification of patterns. In the case of fake content, machine learning can be applied by training a classifier on a sample set of both fake and real content in order to identify the similarities and differences between the two and then have the classifier make a decision on new content to determine whether or not it is fake. Machine learning classifiers analyse features within each piece of content. These features include but are not limited to text-based features (spelling, punctuation, random characters), web-based features (domain name and links), and social-based features (number of likes, shares, comments, and friends/followers).


### Solution:- 
The solution is to develop a web app as a user interface, where the user can login to the application and provide the data in the form of text either in pdf format, or they can provide the URL to the website which has the content to be determined as fake or not. Text can be the content of a news article, blogs, or forums etc, For the special case, the web UI can also be able to determine if the content posted on social media is fake or not and also be able to detect the accuracy and reliability of the content. And the person who published the content online could be detected. To do this Machine learning model can be devised and  this model can be rendered in the web page. The content can be stored so that in the future the user can be aware of the reliability of the content and should be warned if the content is unreliable. And also user will be able to download the recent contents.
